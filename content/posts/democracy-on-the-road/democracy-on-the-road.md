#### Ground Reality is often different


Investment bankers and economists at Manhattan were riding high on the economic liberalization of 1991. New York Indians were certain that voters would reward the current government with a second term to push for deep market reforms. The general elections of 1996 resulted in a hung parliament with Congress went down to stunning defeat. The shock was felt in New York Indians, they couldn't recognise the fact that despite all the good things done, the current PM had no mass base and wasn't able to sell reforms to the public at large. Author suggested to his boss that if they want to analyse an election, they can't call the shots sitting at the office. Corporate office doesn't provide any insight into public sentiments in India. They need to go out, into the streets, on the road and talk to actual voters. Author started arranging election trips covering major state and general elections - comprising a team of journalists and political pundits - team size of 5 growing up to 20 over the years.

India is made up of hundreds of castes and languages and the opinion of many Indians is a great controversy - this makes elections so full of surprises. In the US, you can take a poll of 1000-2000 and produce an election forecast. In India, a much larger sample size produces far less accuracy. As diverse a country as India, it's hard for any one leader to dominate India. One way to govern India effectively is to let it's diverse states govern themselves, each under its own leader. These have been observed in many regional elections. No matter how strong powder is at the center, public sentiments are loyal to their regional leader in regional elections. Individual states can thrive under their own right leader.

#### Elections in India

The one time India comes alive is during election time. The locals line up at large numbers to hear their leader, cheer at them, take a jibe at their opposition. Leaders arrive late by 2-3 hours to their venue, some by route while some by helicopters. Some engage with the crowd, while some read out their transcript and leave. People throng at rallies, sit on rooftops. The gathering is so huge, that it's as close as to a stampede, yet the stampede rarely breaks out. This symbolises how India works- disorganized, chaotic, constantly on the brink, yet miraculously it functions.

To figure out which way the elections would turn- in any state- you had to focus on swing voters- the castes and the individuals most likely to switch their party allegiance. Another lesson on how to question voters in India: ask for a person's name, which tells you their caste and religion, and weigh the answer accordingly. Asking the voter's question is an art in itself. Just make sure you are a *patrakar* and not another party functionary who might ways to punish the voters for voting against the government. Ask the voter the way *hawa* or wind is blowing, and the voter is more likely to reveal his or her preference. Or many will dodge the question by saying the election is a toss-up, '50:50'. Villages show incredible hospitality to outsiders visiting their town. There is acceptability about caste, poverty, unemployment. People believe this is the way of life in the village. Beyond people complaining, the vehicle stops there. There is no more way forward to fix it.

Majority victories are difficult in India, with new regional parties spinning out, rooted in just one or the other caste/sub-castes. Coalition governments are highly fickle. Any small party can pull out of alliance and pull the government down and so could small shifts in the popular opinion of people. This fragility is true across India, especially in deeply casteist states.



#### Politics 

Politics is the downstream of culture. Ruling class symbolizes the masses. The two go hand in hand. While the US is known for its presidential democracy and Britain for its parliamentary democracy, India should be known for its dynastic democracy. Many voters deeply respect dynastic succession. But a surprising turn has also opened the door to single politicians, who present themselves as clean, free agents, committed only to public service, with no family to empower or enrich. This aura of pristine singlehood has been cultivated aggressively by leaders such as Modi and Mamata Banerjee. Jayalalitha winning her first term as chief minister in 1991 pioneered the rise of unmarried politicians. Given how closely Indian life is bound to family and the intense pressure on single people, Jayalalitaa had risen to power in a male-dominated political culture by exercising absolute control over her party

Many Politicians are very accommodating in private life behind elections. Some are reformers in their personal van but populist while giving speech. They might project the public personality of an authoritarian figure, calling out the upper caste, but they will surprisingly present a casual and mild person, welcoming people from all caste and creed. They won't always wage the same war when they are in person as to what they showcase in the campaign. The rhetoric which they show in election campaigns is not reflected in 1:1 behaviour.

As politicians grow in popularity, it's an obvious plus for the candidate. But in Congress its different. Congress had cultivated a stable of competing leaders, all ready to replace if one of the 'other' politicians grew too big for the party's liking. The party plays these games to keep power in the hands of Congress elite and prevent the party fragmenting itself into regional and caste loyalties. However, congress did take steps to ending a culture that treated regional leaders dismissively. These days parties typically replace a third of their incumbent MPs or state assembly members at election time.

Political parties have partnered with persons serving jail terms for political gains. This would seem rather bizarre in other countries- the idea of trying to win over voters by supporting the candidate in jail. In India, voters would feel disgusted by sitting MLAs and MPs accused of corruption, but show sympathy for those who actually get punished and jailed. This reflects what Indians feel towards the justice system. Their hatred towards the justice system runs deep. Two-thirds of the people in Indian prisons are not convicted, merely waiting for a trial; so many innocent people continue to sit in jails. Many Indians have suffered these abuses themselves, which is why so many voters hate the corrupt politicians while they are in office but feel sympathy for those who go to jail. Politicians also try to sell themselves as something they have done for the country. And it seems to work. Politicians advertise their criminal conviction on billboards, and its business as usual in India. Convicts and respectable people serve side by side in the Lok Sabha everyday. How else does one explain why in India candidates with a criminal record are three times more likely to win parliamentary elections than those with a clean record? Milan Vaishav's book - [When Crime Pays : Money and Muscle in Indian politics](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/01/24/when-crime-pays-money-and-muscle-in-indian-politics-pub-66205) is a good book on this topic.


#### South is another India 

The South has less in common with the North, their incomes are four to five times higher, years of schooling longer, and many people have long resented the political dominance of the north. While mass adulation is common in India, Tamil voters take it to a new level. South politics is more of a personality cult politics. In Tamil Nadu, the DMK and AIADMK each claim a party membership of ten million, nearly 15 percent of the state population. And these cadres are bound to their parties more by commitment to its ideology and charismatic leader than by considerations of caste. Empowering freebies in election manifesto and later branding them to the name of the politician has been observed in the south.

#### Rise of Narendra Modi

The author explains the rise of Narendra Modi, the architecture of his campaigning, the rising dominance of social media in Indian politics. He compares the personality cult of Narendra Modi with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 1998, when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then mayor of Istanbul, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for “inciting religious hatred”,many had written off his political future. Out of jail in 1999, he started mobilising supporters on an Islamist conservative agenda which became his vehicle of rise to power. Erdoğan focused on an economic reform agenda and became very popular as the economy boomed, winning subsequent elections by widening margins. He became increasingly successful at the ballot box and success went to Erdogan's head and his autocratic instincts began to emerge. To stifle the resulting protests, he rolled out riot police, blamed foreign conspirators, cracked down on the press and opponents in all walks of Turkish life. The author wonders whether India’s new political messiah might go the Erdoğan way

#### Anti incumbency

>Sarkar tave ki roti jaise hotee hai, usko palat tey raho nahin toh jal ke raakh ho jayegi.’ The government is like a roti that needs to be flipped on the griddle or it will burn.

**India has the highest rate of anti-incumbency among major democracies in the world.** Any single factor can bring the incumbent down, but winning is more complicated. Factors like community family, inflation, welfare, development, corruption and money - any one of the factors rarely decide elections.

Things like dysfunctional public schools are a big reason for frustration with the government. You can outperform on one factor but that doesn't help, you need to clear yourself on multiple parameters. No matter the depth of your intelligence or understanding of the economy, you also need to have larger than life charisma of mass-based leaders to sell your work to the masses in India.


Incumbents can't see their prospects to be good enough, even if their state has improved economic growth or faster growth than the national average. Even if a chief minister produced blockbuster economic success—with growth above 8 per cent—they had a 50:50 chance of getting tossed out. There is much less connection between politics and economics. Public is so frustrated with the functioning of the broken state, that economic growth can't make up for their daily struggles. Welfare promises alone, no matter how generous, won’t win elections. Welfare promises can boost a candidate’s chances many times, but they offer no guarantee.

It's hard to figure out how governments get re-elected in India, but the list of what can topple state or national governments is long, and inflation is high up on that list. Unlike double-digit GDP growth, the impact of double-digit inflation rarely goes unfeeling or unremarked by voters. Often they can recite recent price increases for onions or ghee down to the rupee, because these numbers determine what—or whether—their family eats. The election will remain as unpredictable as a *cat on the wall, you don’t know which way it will jump*

The author ends the book with the optimism that democracy indeed works in India. Political power in India is supreme. No business person will speak out against it. Bureaucrats serve at the mercy of politicians who can transfer them on a whip. And yet, odds are against the ruling class. Ultimate power resides with the Indian voter.
