Moral Licensing is a phenomenon when a certain act or behaviour enables the person to depict or commit a behavior which can be opposite to the previously showcased virtues. When we do something good, in other words, sometimes we then, on occasion, give ourselves permission to do something bad.



But when do people cross ethical lines? Daniel Effron, Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior at London Business School, explains that people ask themselves the question - “Can I get away with it?”. A study called ‘cheat at the end effect’ demonstrates this -  If you give people a bunch of opportunities to cheat and get away with it, the average person will cheat some of the time but not all the time. People dont cheat to the maximum extent because they need to feel like reasonable human beings. If you give people a set number of opportunities to cheat and they know exactly the number of opportunities, people are more likely to cheat at the end.

Effron, in one of his study looked in the area of race and racial discrimination. People supporting black politicians doesn’t always mean that they are radically open and progressive people. If people establish themselves as non-racist by doing something egalitarian, they subsequently feel they can take actions in favour of one group over another. He conducted an experiment on people expressing support for Barack Obama in the U.S Presidential Elections of 2008 and found that the same people express prejudiced behaviours that favour white people over the expense of black people.
