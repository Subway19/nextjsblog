![The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel](psychologyofmoney.png)
### Introduction

The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.

Two contrasting examples:
- Ronald James Read: Gas station attendant, janitor and American philanthropist. Read saved throughout his life, lived frugally and amassed an $8 million net worth at time of death. The majority of his fortune was left to a local hospital and library.
- Richard Fuscone: Harvard-educated Merrill Lynch executive. Borrowed heavily and spent lavishly, got hit by the 2008 financial crisis, declared bankruptcy.
- “Ronald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That’s all it took to eclipse the massive education and experience gap between the two.”

In what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background, no formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best education, the best training, and the best connections? The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. Financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know. . And to grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism.


#### Chapter 1: No one's crazy

You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences. The challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty.

In theory people should make investment decisions based on their goals and the characteristics of the investment options available to them at the time. But that’s not what people do. The economists found that people’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation—especially experiences early in their adult. 

Individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history. For example : 

- If you were born in 1950, the stock market was flat during your teens and 20s (adjusted for inflation).
- If you were born in 1970, the S&P 500 increased 1000% during your teens and 20s (adjusted for inflation).

- Which generation is more likely to have a bullish view of the stock market?

No one should expect members of these groups to go through the rest of their lives thinking the same thing about inflation. Or the stock market. Or unemployment. Or money in general. Their view of money was formed in different worlds. And when that’s the case, a view about money that one group of people thinks is outrageous can make perfect sense to another.

Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into their unique mental model of how the world works. As Housel says, many of the poor financial decisions stem from our collective inexperience: “there is not decades of accumulated experience...we’re winging it.”

#### Chapter 2: Luck and Risk

“Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort...they both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes.” Realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.

 The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money.. The default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a factor of success. After spending years around investors and business leaders I’ve come to realize that someone else’s failure is usually attributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk.

Focus more on broad patterns. Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples—the billionaires, the CEOs, or the massive failures that dominate the news—and extreme examples are often the least applicable to other situations, given their complexity.. You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life.

But more important is that as much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures. Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.


#### Chapter 3 : Never Enough

The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.   If expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel the same after putting in extra effort. It gets dangerous when the taste of having more—more money, more power, more prestige—increases ambition faster than satisfaction. In that case one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps ahead. You feel as if you’re falling behind, and the only way to catch up is to take greater and greater amounts of risk. Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work.

**The problem of social comparison:** The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you.

**Examples of Rajat Gupta and Bernie Madoff:** People who had everything but wanted more. They brought ruin upon themselves because they were greedy and didn’t know when to stop.

There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain. Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough.


The only way to win is to refrain from playing the game.

#### Chapter 4 : Confounding Compounding

**The simplest fact about Warren Buffett’s fortune:** He wasn’t just a good investor, he was a good investor for 75+ years. “Effectively all of Warren Buffett’s financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years. His skill is investing, but his secret is time.”


There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.

Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow. It’s like planting oak trees: A year of growth will never show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference, and 50 years can create something absolutely extraordinary.

#### Chapter 5 : Getting wealthy staying Wealthy

Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own. Getting and keeping extraordinary growth requires surviving all the unpredictable ups and downs that everyone inevitably experiences over time.

More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.

A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality. Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance.

The idea that something can gain over the long run while being a basketcase in the short run is not intuitive, but it’s how a lot of things work in life.

Economies, markets, and careers often follow a similar path—growth amid loss.

#### Chapter 6 : Tails, you win

- Art collector Heinz Berggruen amassed an amazing collection of Picassos, Braques, Klees and Matisses.
- People were amazed by his art investing acumen.
- The reality was that he bought massive quantities of art. Only a subset of his collection was valuable.
- “Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up stupendously right.”


In 2018, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500’s returns. And Amazon’s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and Amazon Web Services, which itself are tail events in a company that has experimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phone to travel agencies. Apple was responsible for almost 7% of the index’s returns in 2018. And it is driven overwhelmingly by the iPhone, which in the world of tech products is as tail-y as tails get.

And who’s working at these companies? Google’s hiring acceptance rate is 0.2%. Facebook’s is 0.1%. Apple’s is about 2%. So the people working on these tail projects that drive tail returns have tail careers. The idea that a few things account for most results is not just true for companies in your investment portfolio. It’s also an important part of your own behavior as an investor.

A venture capital model: If a fund makes 100 investments, they expect 80% to fail, a handful to do reasonably well and 1-2 to drive the funds returns.

When you accept that tails drive everything in business, investing, and finance you realize that it’s normal for lots of things to go wrong, break, fail, and fall.

Something I’ve learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is that no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon. These are not delusions or failures of responsibility. They are a smart acknowledgement of how tails drive success.

You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.


#### Chapter 7 : Freedom

The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”

The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.

Money’s greatest intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time. To obtain, bit by bit, a level of independence and autonomy that comes from unspent assets that give you greater control over what you can do and when you can do it.

Take it from those who have lived through everything: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.


#### Chapter 8 : Man in the Car Paradox
When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, ‘Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.’ Instead, you think, ‘Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.’ In other words, when we signal that we’re wealthy and that people should like and admire us, what really happens is people ignore the person in possession of the object of envy and just focus on the possession.

The point here is not to abandon the pursuit of wealth. Or even fancy cars. It’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.

#### Chapter 9 : Wealth is what you don't see

Someone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or $100,000 more in debt).

We tend to judge wealth by what we see. Cars. Homes. Instagram photos. But the truth is that wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.

When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to spend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire.

Someone driving a $100,000 car is almost certainly rich, But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and setting your own goal


#### Chapter 10: Save Money


People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what others think about them.

Your savings are in your hand. Savings can be created by spending less. You can spend less if you desire less. And you will desire less if you care less about what others think of you. The intangible benefits of money can be far more valuable and capable of increasing your happiness than the tangible things.

What is the return on cash in the bank that gives you the option of changing careers, or retiring early, or freedom from worry? It’s incalculable.

The world used to be hyper-local. Just over 100 years ago 75% of Americans had neither telephones nor regular mail service, according to historian Robert Gordon. That made competition hyper-local. A worker with just average intelligence might be the best in their town, and they got treated like the best because they didn’t have to compete with the smarter worker in another town. That’s now changed. A hyper-connected world means the talent pool you compete in has gone from hundreds or thousands spanning your town to millions or billions spanning the globe. This is especially true for jobs that rely on working with your head versus your muscles: teaching, marketing, analysis, consulting, accounting, programming, journalism, and even medicine increasingly compete in global talent pools.

Intelligence is not a reliable advantage in a world that’s become as connected as ours has. But flexibility is. In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility.

The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.


Having more control over your time and options is becoming one of the most valuable currencies in the world. That’s why more people can, and more people should, save money.



#### Chapter 11: Resonable > Rational

A rational investor makes decisions based on numeric facts. A reasonable investor makes them in a conference room surrounded by co-workers you want to think highly of, with a spouse you don’t want to let down, or judged against the silly but realistic competitors that are your brother-in-law, your neighbor, and your own personal doubts. Investing has a social component that’s often ignored when viewed through a strictly financial lens.


My own view is that people are neither rational nor irrational. We are human. We don’t like to think harder than we need to, and we have unceasing demands on our attention.
The reasonable investors who love their technically imperfect strategies have an edge, because they’re more likely to stick with those strategies.




#### Chapter 12: Surprise


“The majority of what’s happening at any given moment in the global economy can be tied back to a handful of past events that were nearly impossible to predict. History, in any way,is not a map of the future. Scott Sagan (political scientist): “Things that have never happened before happen all the time.”

It’s not a failure of analysis. It’s a failure of imagination. Realizing the future might not look anything like the past is a special kind of skill that is not generally looked highly upon. The world is surprising. we should use past surprises as an admission that we have no idea what might happen next.

The most important economic events of the future—things that will move the needle the most—are things that history gives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedented events. Their unprecedented nature means we won’t be prepared for them, which is part of what makes them so impactful.

That doesn’t mean we should ignore history when thinking about money. But there’s an important nuance: The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. Specific trends, specific trades, specific sectors, specific causal relationships about markets, and what people should do with their money are always an example of evolution in progress.

we should be skeptical of those who profess to know with great certainty how the future will unfold
