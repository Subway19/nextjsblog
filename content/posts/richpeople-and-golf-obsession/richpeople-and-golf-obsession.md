#### Golf course
The typical golf course is 200 acres. For maintenance, you have to landscape it, mow it, drench it in pesticides, keep the sandtraps perfect. When a fancy golf course rebuilds its bunkers, it typically takes about 389 truckloads of sand. Typically, a good private golf course can handle no more than 72 golfers at once, so that’s one golfer per 120,833 square feet. If compared to another sport such as Basketball, a single basket ball court would be 30 acres.

#### A study on Record by United States Golf Association
Lee Biggerstaff conducted a study relating the efficieny of high profile executive(s) of companies and time spent by them on playing golf.

At the top 10% of Biggerstaff’s sample, the CEOs are playing a round at least 37 times a year. 
A round of golf = 4 to 4.5 hours, 37 times a year ~ 160 hours on the course ~ equivalent of 5.5 weeks of work. Adding the time spent driving to the course, warming up, getting changed, having a drink and other activities, the real time is probably way higher.

The study shows that the more golf a CEO plays, the worse his firm does and also that the more golf a CEO plays, the more likely he is to be fired.

#### Bob Hope for Golf Campaign

By property tax law called highest and best use - how much to tax a piece of property is to estimate what its best use might be. If you’ve got a vast golf course in the middle of Beverly Hills or Brentwood, that’s not the highest and best use, so the tax rates should shoot up. This became an issue for the country clubs owners. In 1960, California’s country clubs got together and proposed an amendment to the state constitution that permanently exempts them from the highest and best use standard. For private golf clubs, this was gold because they had to pay a tiny tax compared to the property they are owning.

#### About Prop 13 - California Constitution, 1978

If you own a house, the value of your property is reassessed by the city or county where you live and the local government will raise your taxes accordingly. Except in California. Proposition 13 said that, for tax purposes, the value of any piece of property in California is frozen at pre-1978 levels and the only way that property can be reassessed at its real, current value if the ownership of more than 50% of the property changes hands. The post 1978 pay normal property taxes and the people living in the same house they owned in 1978 and earlier, pay less tax.

A newspaper questioned that when members leave or die, isn’t it change of ownership and so in the brief period of time, shouldn’t the golf clubs be taxed according to real rates rather than pre-1978 rates? The county’s tax court issued a ruling in favour of golf clubs They conclude, “No, country clubs haven’t changed ownerships.” 


#### Philosophical Question : The ship of Theseus
<h6>Synopsis</h6>  
Theseus is sailing on a ship(A) and, one by one, he replaces every one of the original planks that make up that ship with a new plank until every single piece of the ship is new. The question is, when Theseus reaches shore, is he sailing on the same ship as he was when he left or a new ship?

Scenario 1: It’s a new ship. The identity of something is the sum of its component parts; change the parts, you change the thing.

Scenario 2 : that an object can maintain its identity so long as the change is gradual. So the ship is still the old ship.

Scenario 3 : Suppose the parts which are being replaced are collected by someone and then he builds a new ship(B) using the same parts. Now which is the ‘The ship of Theseus’? A or B?

###### The law board ruling in favour of golf clubs by Scenario 2.

For years, the taxpayers of Los Angeles subsidize a hell lot to one of the swankiest country clubs in the world. Malcolm Gladwell's opinion - "This is perpetuating inequality and injustice. Golf clubs need to give something back. Remove private memberships. Allow ordinary citizens to enter and enjoy the golf clubs." Gladwell also looks into golf clubs of Los Angeles by the lens of aristocratic institutions. St. Andrews in Scotland, is open to the general public on Sundays. Rosedale Country golf club is open to the general public except the summer. Canada and the United Kingdom, they have an actual aristocracy. But, their golf courses are open to public.
